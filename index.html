          <h2>Hindu Ruler</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Shivaji I (Shivaji Bhonsle; Marathi pronunciation: </b>
            February 1630 – 3 April 1680[5]), also referred to as Chhatrapati
            Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle
            Maratha clan.[6] Eventually, Shivaji carved out his own independent
            kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which
            formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally
            crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.[7] Over the
            course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and
            hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda,
            Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's
            military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing
            and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established
            a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured
            administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political
            traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi
            and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and
            administration.[7][8] Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and
            time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take on
            increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence
            movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a
            proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.
